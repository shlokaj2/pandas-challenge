# pandas-challenge

I have completed most of the district summary and school summary sections. I'm getting errors on some parts of those sections. The rest of the assignment has not been completed yet because I am having trouble understanding how to do the rest of it, anything I tried would come back with errors. 

I'm also having trouble with git pushing my Jupyter Notebook file on here again and therefore, I have taken screenshots of my work and put it on a Word document and put it in the PyCitySchools folder. I will continue to work on this and resubmit it at a later time.
